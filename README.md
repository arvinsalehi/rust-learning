# Rust Learning Repository

This repository is designed for my own learning journey with Rust programming language. Here, I'll be storing my code snippets, exercises, and notes as I progress. This repo is based on the documentation of [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Getting Started

To get started with my Rust learning journey:

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust on your machine. You can do this by following the instructions on the official Rust website: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arvinsalehi/rust-learning.git
    ```

3. **Explore the Contents**: Once cloned, explore the contents to find tutorials, examples, and exercises. You'll find organized directories covering different aspects of Rust programming.

### tips
- Inappropriate language in use in scripts. BE CAREFUL :) 
- OD = Original Docs link.
- OG = Think of 2Pac in Rap industry.
