# Rust Learning Repository

This repository is designed for my own learning journey with Rust programming language. Here, I'll be storing my code snippets, exercises, and notes as I progress. This repo is based on the documentation of [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Getting Started

To get started with my Rust learning journey:

1. **Install Rust**: If you haven't already, install Rust on your machine. You can do this by following the instructions on the official Rust website: [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Clone this Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/arvinsalehi/rust-learning.git
    ```

3. **Explore the Contents**: Once cloned, explore the contents to find tutorials, examples, and exercises. You'll find organized directories covering different aspects of Rust programming.

### tips
- Inappropriate language in use in scripts. BE CAREFUL :) 
- OD = Original Docs link.
- OG = Think of 2Pac in Rap industry.

## Contents
- **[Leet Code](https://github.com/arvinsalehi/rust-learning/tree/main/leet_code/longest_consecutive_seq)**: After Collections, the best practice in my mind was to solve the leet code problems with rust. (this link should be after the collections link. However, for ease of access (And to Show off), I've decided to put it at the start.
